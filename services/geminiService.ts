Your response must follow these rules precisely:
1.  **Determine Location Type:** Is it a specific 'point' (a single monument) or a larger 'area' (a city, park, region)? Set 'locationType' accordingly.
2.  **Provide Google Place ID:** You MUST provide the official Google Place ID for the location in the 'placeId' field. This is non-negotiable.
3.  **Engaging Description:** Write a concise, engaging 1-2 sentence description.
4.  **Tailored Details:** Generate an array of 2 to 4 key details that are *specifically relevant* to this place and its category. Use insightful, custom labels.
5.  **Icons:** For each detail, provide a custom 'label', a 'value', and an 'icon' name from this list: ['calendar', 'globe', 'geology', 'architecture', 'growth', 'time', 'sparkles'].
6.  **Country Detail:** Always include one detail for the location's country using the 'globe' icon.

Example for category 'growth' (Venice - an 'area'):
- locationType: 'area'
- placeId: 'ChIJi7b5IqxdFYwR3a0IuTEb_gU'
- A detail could be { "label": "Maritime Republic", "value": "Dominated Mediterranean trade for centuries", "icon": "growth" }.`;

ANALYZE the following place:
- Name: ${place.name}
- Category: ${place.category}
- Description: ${place.description}
- Details: ${JSON.stringify(place.details)}

Based on this, determine what users would be most interested in seeing. Create 1-5 slides (you decide the optimal number) based on what's most compelling about this specific location.

AVAILABLE SLIDE TYPES:
- "overview" - Stunning introduction to the place
- "historical_timeline" - Key events and historical periods

- "then_vs_now" - Historical appearance vs current state
- "architectural_details" - Unique construction, design, engineering marvels

CONTENT STRATEGY:
- For ANCIENT places: Focus on architectural marvels, construction techniques, cultural significance, historical context
- For NATURE places: Focus on geological formation, natural processes, human interaction with landscape, scenic beauty
- For GROWTH places: Focus on transformation over time, urban development, before/after comparisons
- For TIME places: Focus on multiple historical layers, geological time scales, civilization changes

REQUIREMENTS:
- Title: 2-4 words max (punchy, engaging)
- Subtitle: One compelling sentence (8-15 words)
- Key points: Maximum 3 bullet points, each 5-10 words
- Image prompts: HIGHLY DETAILED, specific prompts for AI image generation
- Choose slides that tell the most interesting story about this specific place

DETAILED IMAGE PROMPT GUIDELINES:
- Include specific architectural styles, materials, colors
- Mention historical clothing, people, activities if relevant
